#  Copilot Prompt Used:
Draft a Pull Request description for a major refactor.
Old module: `legacy_reporting_module.py` (synchronous, basic error handling)
New module: `new_reporting_service.py` (asynchronous, robust error handling, batching)
Key changes:
- Switched from `requests` to `aiohttp` for async HTTP.
- Implemented exponential backoff for API retries.
- Added Pytest unit and integration tests.
- Improved data fetching performance by 30% through batching.
Problem solved: Performance bottlenecks and unhandled API failures in legacy reporting.
Testing: Extensive unit tests, integration tests against mock API.
Reviewer focus: Concurrency patterns, error handling, test coverage.

##  Pull Request Description (Generated by Copilot)

### Summary
This PR introduces a complete refactor of the legacy reporting module by replacing `legacy_reporting_module.py` with `new_reporting_service.py`. The new module adopts asynchronous programming practices to significantly improve performance and reliability.

### Problem Solved
The legacy implementation relied on synchronous API calls and minimal error handling, leading to performance bottlenecks and unhandled failures when APIs were slow or unavailable.

### Key Changes
- Migrated from `requests` to `aiohttp` for async HTTP communication.
- Implemented exponential backoff strategy for resilient API retries.
- Batched API calls to improve throughput and reduce latency.
- Added comprehensive unit and integration tests using Pytest.

### Performance Improvements
Benchmarking shows an approximate **30% improvement** in report generation time due to async batching.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover individual service components.
- Integration tests validate API interaction with a mock server.
- Tests are automated and part of CI pipeline.

### Reviewer Notes
Focus on:
- Correctness of async logic and task handling
- Error handling and retry strategy
- Completeness and clarity of tests
