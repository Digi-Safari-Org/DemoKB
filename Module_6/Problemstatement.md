##  Module 6: Documentation & Codebase Navigation

### Objectives 
    - Create clear, structured, and compliant project documentation for enterprise use.

    - Generate and maintain a CHANGELOG.md file following industry best practices.

    - Define contribution guidelines and enforce code ownership/security policies.

    - Improve codebase navigation by documenting complex functions in a dedicated reference file.

    - Enhance code transparency with telemetry-aware comments.

    - Incorporate enterprise-specific usage policies into the documentation.

    - Effectively use GitHub Copilot Enterprise to draft and refine technical documentation.

## Instructions
Your team has been assigned to bring a legacy microservice repository up to **enterprise documentation standards**.  

Currently, the project has:
- A very basic `README.md` with no structured sections
- No `CHANGELOG.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Inconsistent or missing code comments
- No central place to query project-specific information

As part of the **Enterprise AI Enablement** initiative, you are required to update, create, and organize project documentation, and enable intelligent navigation using GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

## Tasks

1. **Improve the README.md**  
   - Add structured sections such as **Overview**, **Installation**, **Usage**, and **Enterprise Compliance Notes**.  
   - Ensure compliance notes accurately reflect security and privacy requirements.

2. **Generate a CHANGELOG.md**  
   - Use commit history to create a changelog following the **Keep a Changelog** format.  
   - Include all notable changes and add any missing release notes.

3. **Create a CONTRIBUTING.md**  
   - Define contribution steps, branch naming conventions, commit message guidelines, pull request process, and review steps.  
   - Include mandatory security review procedures and code ownership rules.

4. **Document a Complex Function**  
   - Select a non-trivial function from the `/src` directory.  
   - Write a simple, clear explanation suitable for a project wiki.  
   - Save it to `/docs/FunctionReference.md`.

5. **Add Telemetry-Aware Code Comments**  
   - Identify any function that sends or logs telemetry data.  
   - Add docstrings that describe telemetry-related behavior and compliance warnings.


6. **Add Enterprise-Specific Context to Documentation**  
   - In `README.md`, include an **Enterprise Usage Policy** section.  
   - This should outline security clearance levels, data handling rules, and mandatory code scanning requirements.

7. **Commit and Push All Changes**  
   - Stage all updated and new files.  
   - Commit with a descriptive message.  
   - Push to the remote repository.
