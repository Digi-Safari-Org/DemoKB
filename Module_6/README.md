<!-- Please rewrite the repository's README to be clear and structured. Include these sections:
- Project title and one-line summary
- Overview (what it does)
- Quickstart (installation and a one-line run example)
- Usage (what main.py does and example output)
- Development (how to run locally, dev commands)
- Testing (how to run tests; if none, say how to add tests)
- Contributing (brief pointer to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Enterprise Compliance Notes (data handling, telemetry, how to disable telemetry)
Keep it concise, use markdown headings, and give a short code example for running the app. -->


<!-- Add an "Enterprise Usage Policy" section for this README describing:
- who can approve telemetry endpoints
- how to handle PII (redaction/hashing)
- how to request exceptions
- required automated scanning (static analysis, SCA)
- retention and logging rules
Format as a short policy for developers. -->


## Enterprise Usage Policy

- **Telemetry Endpoints:** Only designated enterprise security or compliance leads may approve telemetry endpoints. All telemetry integrations must be reviewed and documented.
- **PII Handling:** Do not log or transmit personally identifiable information (PII). If PII is unavoidable, apply redaction or cryptographic hashing before storage or transmission.
- **Exception Requests:** To request exceptions to these policies, submit a formal request to your enterprise security team with justification and mitigation steps.
- **Automated Scanning:** All code must pass automated static analysis and software composition analysis (SCA) scans before merging to main branches.
- **Retention and Logging:** Logs must not retain sensitive data and should follow your organization's retention policies. Access to logs must be restricted and auditable.
